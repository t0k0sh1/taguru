# Taguru client protocol

You (an LLM) are the intended client. This is the discipline for
ingesting knowledge into, and retrieving it from, an association
network. The server handles structure only — understanding language,
choosing contexts, decomposing documents into facts, and composing
answers back into prose are your job.

## Model

- Knowledge is **(subject, label, object, weight, source)**
  associations. Weight is signed; negative asserts "not" (「大量生産を
  行わない」→ `{"subject":"青嶺酒造","label":"行う","object":"大量生産","weight":-1.0}`).
- Re-asserting a triple adds weight and keeps per-source attributions:
  2 sources × 1.0 (independent corroboration) stays distinguishable
  from 1 source × 2.0 (one emphatic claim).
- **One context = one 文脈.** One spelling means one referent. Apple
  the fruit and Apple the company belong in different contexts.
- The graph is an index, not an archive. Register originals through
  the sources API and reach them back via attribution source ids.

## Retrieval loop

1. **Pick a context**: `GET /contexts` lists names, human-written
   descriptions, mechanical stats (association counts, top concepts,
   label sample — these never go stale), and usage counters (reads,
   empty reads, writes, last-read/write unix seconds).
2. **Resolve cues**: extract entity and relation candidates from the
   question; `resolve` (concepts) / `resolve_label` (relations). The
   entry is normalized — width, case, katakana/hiragana, light typos
   all land. On a miss: reword, or lower `dice_floor` (default 0.3 →
   e.g. 0.2) to widen fuzzy matching for one call. If the server has
   embeddings, a semantic tier joins whenever lexical candidates are
   absent or weak (best score < 0.5): appended with `tier:"semantic"`,
   scored by cosine — never compare scores across tiers. Names are
   embedded as graph-context glosses, so paraphrases (醸造責任者→杜氏)
   and question-shaped cues land too. Still empty → probably the wrong
   context; try the next candidate.
   Lexical candidates carry `kind`: `exact`/`alias` mean the cue IS a
   stored spelling; `containment`/`fuzzy` mean it merely overlaps one —
   a high score there can be a lookalike, not the thing (京都 scores
   0.67 against 東京都, `possible` 0.8 against `impossible`). The top
   candidates carry `gloss`, the name plus its heaviest facts: read it
   before adopting a containment/fuzzy hit — string overlap says two
   names are near, the glosses say whether they are the same thing.
   Never adopt a lookalike on score alone.
3. **Outline, then narrow**: `describe` a hub concept first (which
   labels, how many, per role), then `query` just the facets you need
   (`"label": ["住所","職歴"]`). Don't pull whole profiles.
4. **Expand and rank**: `activate` spreads from origins (strongest
   first, `path` shows the route; strength is an ordering within one
   call — never compare across calls). `explore` walks structure
   exhaustively with hop-distance annotations.
5. **Answer from the originals**: attributions from `recall`, `query`,
   `explore`, `activate`, and `unreachable_from` already carry a
   resolved `section` label — enrichment on the graph read, not
   something you need to fetch (`null` with no `paragraph` locator, or
   when the locator falls outside every section the source has
   stored). For the verbatim text itself, call
   `POST /contexts/{name}/citations` with `{source, paragraph}`
   when a `paragraph` locator is present — one excerpt, with the same
   `section` alongside it. Without a `paragraph`, there is no located
   excerpt; feed the source id to `POST /contexts/{name}/sources/lookup`
   instead and ground your wording in the whole passage. Reflect
   negative weights as negation and attribution counts as strength of
   support.
6. **Switch to the text lane**: knowledge that never fit a triple
   (procedural detail, conditions, discourse) was never in the graph.
   When graph results can't compose the answer, run
   `POST /contexts/{name}/sources/search` — paragraph search with a
   lexical lane (BM25) fused with a semantic lane (paragraph
   embeddings) where the server has them. Graph first, text as the
   safety net.
   - **Phrase the query as an answer, not a question.** Most embedding
     models place a question ("What plan includes SSO?") measurably
     farther from its answer ("SSO is available on the Enterprise
     plan.") than two independently phrased statements sit from each
     other. Guess a plausible declarative sentence and search with
     THAT — the guess does not need to be correct, only shaped like
     the text you hope to find. It costs nothing when the lexical lane
     would have found it anyway, and recovers what the lexical lane
     alone would miss.
   - Each hit's `lanes` field says which lane surfaced it at what
     rank. A vector-only hit is the paraphrase case; a BM25-only hit
     matched wording. Both are evidence, not verdicts — read the text.

## Ingest loop

1. Decompose the document into (subject, label, object, weight).
   - **Check before mint**: `resolve` / `resolve_label` before coining
     any spelling; reuse what exists. `GET /contexts/{name}/labels`
     lists the relation vocabulary. A near-hit whose gloss shows a
     DIFFERENT thing (a lookalike, not your entity) → keep your own
     spelling and record the distinction (step 5), so the collision
     warns instead of confusing from then on.
   - Don't re-assert paraphrases within one document (inflates
     weight). DO re-assert across documents (that's corroboration).
   - Negation: positive label, negative weight.
   - Make implicit membership explicit (whose 杜氏 is 高瀬? — add the
     edge).
2. `POST /contexts/{name}/associations` in batches — one document per
   request, a `source` on every element.
3. Register originals: `POST /contexts/{name}/sources` (source id →
   passage). Store the document's full text as-is: the server splits it
   into paragraphs internally (blank-line boundaries) and searches at
   paragraph granularity, so a long document does not bury its best
   paragraph. Blank lines between logical units are what make that
   split work — keep them. Optionally attach doc2query `questions` —
   per paragraph, the questions a user would type whose answer is that
   paragraph, phrased AWAY from its wording; on servers with passage
   embedding they index beside the paragraph and catch question-shaped
   searches its own vector misses.
4. Audit reachability: `POST /contexts/{name}/unreachable_from` with
   the document's main entities. Non-empty = membership edges are
   missing. If embeddings are configured, finish with
   `POST /contexts/{name}/embeddings/refresh` (diff-only, idempotent;
   unnecessary when the server runs `TAGURU_EMBED_AUTO`).
5. At milestones, `POST /contexts/{name}/vocabulary/audit` lists fork
   candidates (lexical twins = spelling drift, semantic twins =
   synonym forks). Candidates, not verdicts — adjudicate each pair:
   - Same referent → pick one canonical, point an alias at it, use
     the canonical from then on. (Forks that already accumulated
     facts cannot be merged — that's rebuild territory.)
   - Different things that will keep colliding (前株/後株 company
     names, 東京都/京都) → record the distinction as an ordinary
     fact: `{"subject": "株式会社青嶺", "label": "別物", "object":
     "青嶺株式会社", "weight": 1.0}`. One direction is enough —
     glosses carry incoming edges too, so both names warn in
     resolve's evidence from then on, even before either concept has
     any other fact. Use one label consistently per context (`別物`,
     or `distinct_from` in English vocabularies).
6. When live wording misses, register alternate spellings:
   `POST /contexts/{name}/aliases`. Aliases are entry-only; results
   always return the canonical. An alias cannot join two existing
   concepts (that would be a merge — rebuild territory). A
   mis-registered spelling is withdrawn with `DELETE` on the same
   path (exact spellings; canonical names are refused — removal
   cannot unname a record), which frees it to point elsewhere.
7. **Document updated? Sync the diff**:
   `POST /contexts/{name}/sources/retract` withdraws the old version's
   contributions (weights, attributions, passage), then ingest the new
   version normally. Concepts and edges remain; only weights come
   down.

## Procedures (ordered knowledge)

Steps become concept nodes woven with three kinds of edges — no new
machinery, same rank as membership edges and negative weights:

```json
[{"subject":"日本酒の醸造","label":"最初の工程","object":"洗米","weight":1.0,"source":"工程書"},
 {"subject":"洗米","label":"次の工程","object":"浸漬","weight":1.0,"source":"工程書"},
 {"subject":"日本酒の醸造","label":"工程","object":"洗米","weight":1.0,"source":"工程書"}]
```

- **Order** is the `次の工程` chain (fix ONE canonical label; branches
  are just several `次の工程` edges — a DAG). **Start** is
  `最初の工程`. **Membership** (`工程`) ties every step to the hub,
  for coverage audits.
- **Replay**: query the start, then `query {label:"次の工程"}` for all
  pairs at once and sort them (or step along with the subject pinned).
  **Never use `explore` distance for order** — membership edges create
  hub shortcuts that disagree with chain position.
- Same-named steps shared across procedures → qualify the name
  (「醸造の蒸米」). One spelling, one referent applies to steps too.
- Sources disagreeing about order surface as low-weight `次の工程`
  edges — normal weight arithmetic.
- Step detail (amounts, conditions, tips) stays in sources, found via
  `sources/search` — don't force it into triples.

## Causality

Cause → effect as directed edges, with canonical labels (`引き起こす`
/ `高める` / `防ぐ` / `要因`… — `resolve_label` before minting):

```json
[{"subject":"ストレス","label":"引き起こす","object":"不眠","weight":1.0,"source":"論文A"},
 {"subject":"カフェイン","label":"引き起こす","object":"不眠","weight":-0.8,"source":"論文C"},
 {"subject":"運動","label":"防ぐ","object":"不眠","weight":1.0,"source":"論文D"}]
```

- "Why X" = `query {label:["引き起こす","高める","要因"], object:"X"}`;
  "what does X lead to" pins the subject instead. Chains come back
  through `activate` paths — the system shows A→B→C but never asserts
  A→C; transitivity is your judgment.
- Disputed causality = small net weight + split attributions on one
  edge. Say so in the answer.
- Denial ("does not cause") is negative weight on the causal label;
  prevention is its own positive label. Don't conflate them.
- Weight is evidence mass, never effect size. "2× risk" goes in the
  object (`喫煙 →リスク倍率→ 2倍`) or stays in the passage.
- Correlation stays `相関する`; don't promote it to causation.
- Conditional ("only when fasting") or compound ("A and B together")
  causes: reify an event/compound node, or leave them to the text
  lane.

## Code

Source code takes the same discipline; only the naming changes.

- Concepts are identifiers in their exact spelling, SHORT names:
  `fetch_block`, not `CacheStore::fetch_block` — qualification dilutes
  entry scores. Namespace with edges (`defined_in` → `src/store.rs`);
  files and paths are concepts too.
- Fix a small label vocabulary up front and reuse it: `kind`,
  `defined_in`, `calls`, `field`, `variant`, `returns`, `invariant`,
  `purpose` cover most code facts.
- Case twins (`Frame` the type, `frame` the accessor) are separate
  concepts and `resolve` returns both at 1.0 — fan out over top-score
  ties and disambiguate with `describe`. Never merge them.
- The entry absorbs camelCase/snake_case/case/typos: `fetchBlock` and
  `evict_cld` land on the snake_case originals. Add natural-language
  aliases onto identifiers (`退避ループ` → `evict_cold`) for language
  entry.
- Passages: one function or type per source id
  (`src/wire.rs:seal_frame`), raw code as the text. Passage search
  matches whole identifiers and their camelCase/snake_case pieces;
  crossing languages (Japanese cue → English comment) is the semantic
  tier's job, not the text lane's.
- The highest-value facts are what grep cannot answer: invariants,
  purposes, design constraints — store them as edges on the
  identifier.

## Auth

- If the server sets `TAGURU_API_TOKEN`, every request except
  `/health` and `/metrics` needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`;
  missing or wrong → `401` in the error shape below.
- The MCP bridge (taguru-mcp) reads its own `TAGURU_API_TOKEN` and
  attaches it to every request — when the server turns auth on, set
  the same value on the bridge.
- Unset = auth disabled (dev mode; never expose beyond localhost).
- Keys may carry a scope (`TAGURU_KEY_SCOPES`): a role — read (the
  retrieval loop) ⊂ write (+ the ingest loop) ⊂ admin (+ context
  deletion, `/import`, `/flush`) — and optionally a context list.
  Out of scope → `403` in the error shape, naming what the key lacks;
  a context-scoped key sees only its grant in `GET /contexts`. Scopes
  bind MCP tool calls exactly as raw HTTP.

## Errors and limits

- `401` auth (above). `404` unknown context. `409` duplicate create /
  alias conflict.
- `507` context full (`ContextFull`) — the write was NOT applied;
  further knowledge goes to a new context.
- `501` `/embeddings/refresh` without a provider configured
  (server-side TAGURU_EMBED_*). `502` embedding provider failure
  (refresh, or the semantic fallback inside resolve) — retry later.
- `400`: association batch over 10,000 per request (nothing applied —
  split and resend; alias batches and removals share the same cap) /
  list-shaped read input over 1,000 items (origins, query terms,
  `sources/lookup` sources — split the request) / weight not finite
  or |weight| > 1,000,000
  (whole batch refused) / name too long (subject, label, object,
  source, alias ≤ 1024 bytes — names are headings, not bodies:
  passages go to sources, long knowledge gets decomposed; context
  name ≤ 64, description ≤ 4096). `408` timeout (default 30 s —
  narrow the query and retry). `413` body over the cap (default
  8 MiB; this one answers in plain text, not the JSON error shape).
  `429` this key is over its request budget — wait the `Retry-After`
  seconds and continue; prefer batching writes over rapid-fire calls.
- Off-axis errors answer in the same shape: unknown path `404`, right
  path wrong verb `405`, broken JSON `400`, wrong Content-Type `415`,
  well-formed but mistyped JSON `422`.
- recall / query / explore / unreachable_from default `limit` to 100.
  `total` above the returned count = truncation
  (recall/query/unreachable_from keep the strongest |weight|, explore
  keeps the nearest hops). Narrow or raise `limit` — capped at 1000
  everywhere.
- A write that returned 200 is durable via the WAL (it survives a
  crash and replays on restart). Only when the server runs
  `TAGURU_WAL=0` can writes inside the flush interval (default 5 s)
  be lost.
